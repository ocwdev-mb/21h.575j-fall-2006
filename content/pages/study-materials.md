15. What is Tarabai's opinion on the contemporary social reforms?
16. Would you argue that Tarabai's tract is more than a critique of patriarchy? How does it compare with Ramabai's High Caste Hindu Woman?

6. What is her attitude towards the British Government? Towards Indian nationalists like Gandhi?
7. Mayo talks a lot about Indian women and their pitiful conditions. Does that make her a champion of women's rights in India?
8. In your view that is the most convincing/preposterous description of Indian women in the book?
9. What is the historical context within which the book was written?
10. The British hold the majority in the Indian legislature. Then why are there so few legislations to improve the condition of Indian women?
